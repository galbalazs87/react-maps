# Udacity Neighborhood Map (React)

This is the final project in my Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. In this challenge we were tasked with using several different APIs including Google Maps, and other location-based services like Foursquare.

In my list on the map are my favourite places in my neighborhood where I live in Hungary.

The app allows the user to filter down the list as they type. Then it displays the locations on the map.

## Run the project online

I've posted my project online on my [personal website](http://galbalazs.co.hu/maps/)


## Features of the project

1. You can click on any marker on the map to see the details of the location fetched from the Foursquare API.
2. You can search through various locations.
3. You can get information of the locations from the search bar or through clickin on marker.

## Installing the project

- Install node.js

### NOTE

It is important to note that, the assets will only be cached when we are on production mode.
